I'm the Head of Data Science at [BLU](http://www.useblu.com.br), a fast paced growing company devoted to revolutionize the Brazilian retail sector. Prior joining BLU I worked for [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/) (Brazilian National Statistical Office) for almost 10 years and my last position was Research and Development Manager where I led efforts towards Big Data, smarter data collection and Time Series methodology. I also worked as a consultant on Machine Learning and Data Science projects for both public and private companies (such as M4U, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Sao Paulo State Government, Petrobras among others). 

My academic life has been dedicated to Time Series Forecasting problems and Machine Learning applications. I hold a PhD in Industrial Engineering, a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and a Bachelor degree in Statistics and have published on important academic journals such as the International Journal of Forecasting and Journal of Air Transport Management.
